🚀 Welcome to my GitHub! I am Jagadeesh Bodavula, a Software Development Engineer who enjoys building scalable, reliable systems and turning complex workflows into simple, observable, and resilient platforms.

Currently, I work at Amazon on large-scale distributed systems that power the onboarding and compliance lifecycle of Amazon Flex drivers worldwide. My day-to-day work spans designing backend services, building event-driven architectures, and shipping production features that directly impact marketplace growth, operational efficiency, and customer experience at scale. I’ve owned and delivered multiple region-wide launches, built fault-tolerant systems using AWS (Lambda, SNS, SQS, DLQs), and implemented end-to-end observability to improve service health, incident response, and business visibility.

I enjoy working close to real problems, whether that’s improving system reliability, enforcing compliance and risk controls, reducing operational overhead, or refining internal tools and UIs to make teams faster and more effective. I’m particularly drawn to roles where I can own features end-to-end, from design to production, and continuously iterate based on data and feedback.

Beyond core backend and distributed systems work, I’m deeply interested in Generative AI and applied AI systems. I’ve been actively learning and experimenting with AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, AI agents, knowledge bases, and MCP-based agent architectures, focusing on how GenAI can be integrated responsibly into real production workflows to improve productivity, automation, and decision-making not just demos.

My technical interests sit at the intersection of:

Distributed systems & backend engineering

Cloud-native architectures (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform)

Observability, reliability, and operational excellence

Applied GenAI, AI agents, and intelligent automation

I value clean system design, strong fundamentals, and writing code that is easy to reason about at scale. I’m always excited to work on problems that challenge me to think deeper about performance, correctness, and long-term system behavior, especially in environments where impact is real and measurable.

🔧 Let's connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together! Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration or just to chat about all things tech.
